# webScrapper

This is my first https://nomadcoders.co python project. \
I hope to build another python project using Django and Docker.

### Time sepnt
I spent about 1 day finishing the course, but about 3 days changing the website to scrape from indeed.com to simplyhired.com due to Indeed blocking bots srapping their data.
